    "General Purpose AI": "A model capable of performing a wide variety of tasks across multiple domains without requiring task-specific customization.",
    "Autonomous Adaptation": "The ability of an AI system to modify its behavior and learn new tasks without human intervention or explicit reprogramming.",
    "AI System Categories": "Specific classifications or types of AI models, such as narrow AI, general AI, or specific categories under the European AI Act.",
    "System Limitations": "Constraints or known weaknesses in the system's capabilities, such as accuracy, scope, or operational boundaries.",
    "Explanations": "The process by which an AI system provides reasoning or justifications for the outputs or decisions it generates, enhancing transparency.",
